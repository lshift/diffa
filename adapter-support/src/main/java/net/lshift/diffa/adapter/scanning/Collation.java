 * This type represents the concept of an ordering of ids. This is so that
 * we can parameterise the ordering-sensitive parts of our code (Eg: the
 * DigestBuilder, output from the VersionCorrelationStore) in order to
 * support systems who might use an ordering that differs from doing naive
 * ASCII string comparisons. Eg: MySQL uses a swedish case insensitive
 * collation by default, where the case is considered to be less important
 * than the relative ordering of the character within the alphabet.
 * So with a varchar primary key with a case insensitive collation, you might end up
 * with the following ordering:
 *
 * [foo, FooBar, fooBar2]
 *
 * Wheras with a plain ASCII-ordered ordering, we would have:
 *
 * [FooBar, foo, fooBar2]
