# Diffa

Diffa is an [open source][license] data analysis tool that automatically establishes data differences between two or more real-time systems. 

Diffa will help you compare local or distributed systems for data consistency, without having to stop them running or implement manual cross-system comparisons. The interface provides you with simple visual summary of any consistency breaks and tools to investigate the issues. 

Diffa is the ideal tool to use to investigate where or when inconsistencies are occuring, or simply to provide confidence that your systems are running in perfect sync. It can be used operationally as an early warning system, in deployment for release verification, or in development with other enterprise diagnosis tools to help troubleshoot faults.

### Features

* Real time alerting when two systems differ
* Compose representative workflows by [pairing][pair] systems into [groups][group]
* Heat map based [UI][diff] that supports continuous differencing of a number of paired systems
* Ability to drill down into the detail of a difference in order to repair it
* Configure your acceptable difference resolution periods
* Participating systems are not tied to a particular language
