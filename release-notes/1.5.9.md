# Version 1.5.9 Change Log (2013-04-16)

## Release Overview

This release addresses some issues found around timezones, adds some exception handling and logging to some background threads, and in the UI expands the viewing area of the content viewer.

## General Maintenance

* Handled and logged exceptions in escalation manager and diff sweeper background threads so issues like loss of database or network instability don't cause the timers to die silently
* Fixed some timezone related issues that came up as the clocks changed to daylight savings
* Increased the width and height of the content inspector widget for improved diff viewing pleasure

## Upgrading

Diffa will automatically upgrade itself to this version from release 1.4.4.1.
