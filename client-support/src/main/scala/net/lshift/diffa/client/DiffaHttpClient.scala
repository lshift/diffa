/**
 * DiffaHttpClient acts as an anti-corruption-layer so that:
 * 1) We have an easily mockable and relatively stateless interface for
 *   dealing with external HTTP-based services
 * 2) So that we can keep the technical details of dealing with the underlying
 * HTTP Library separate from the diffa protocol logic.
 *
 * This does still leak some of the underlying implementation detail, as
 * reading the InputStream can still throw exceptions, eg: if the stream is
 * closed prematurely.
